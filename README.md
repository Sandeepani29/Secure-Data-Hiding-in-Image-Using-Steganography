Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a secure and efficient steganography system for hiding sensitive information within digital images. It aims to ensure confidential communication by embedding secret data in a way that is visually undetectable. This technique preserves image quality while providing robust protection against detection tools, making it suitable for secure data transmission across various sectors.
 Features
 Secure data embedding using advanced steganography techniques  
 High-quality image preservation without noticeable distortion  
 Resistance to steganalysis attacks and detection tools  
 Real-time data embedding and extraction  
 Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP) 
 
 Installations
